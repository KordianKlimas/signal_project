The Health Data Simulator orchestrates a comprehensive array of data generators and output strategies to emulate health data for a specified number of patients.
Central to its functionality are several key components:

Data Generators:
These include the ECGDataGenerator, BloodLevelsDataGenerator, AlertGenerator, BloodPressureDataGenerator, and BloodSaturationDataGenerator.
Each of these generators implements the PatientDataGenerator interface, mandating the presence of the generate method.
This unified interface ensures consistency in generating diverse health data types.

Output Strategies:
The simulator leverages various output strategies such as TcpOutputStrategy, ConsoleOutputStrategy, WebSocketOutputStrategy, and FileOutputStrategy.
These strategies conform to the OutputStrategy interface, facilitating seamless integration into the simulator's architecture.

HealthDataSimulator Class:
Responsible for initializing both the data generators and output strategies, the HealthDataSimulator class plays a pivotal role in coordinating the simulation process.
It employs a ScheduledExecutorService to schedule tasks for each patient systematically. By default, the ConsoleOutputStrategy is set as the primary output mechanism.
By encapsulating these functionalities within a well-structured architecture, the Health Data Simulator offers unparalleled flexibility and customizability in simulating diverse health data scenarios, catering to a wide range of use cases with ease.

Data Storage System:
allows to store medical Patient's and staff data.

Alert Genertaion System:
creates and manages basicAlerts based on  Storage System data

Alert Genertaion System:
creates and manages basicAlerts based on  Storage System data

Data Access Layer:
allows staff to add and retrive any information about patients, and  basicAlerts staff  via console giving description of patient's condition
